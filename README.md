# Edgeware Contracts Workshop

Edgeware is blockchain platform with support for [WASM Contracts Pallet](https://docs.edgewa.re/edgeware-runtime/wasm) and [EVM Ethereum compability layer](https://docs.edgewa.re/edgeware-runtime/evm).

This is a self-guided tutorial which will teach you how to build both [WASM](https://webassembly.org/) and EVM-based smart contracts on [Edgeware](https://github.com/hicommonwealth/edgeware-node).

In the [WASM tutorials](0/introduction.md), we will cover:

1. Installing prerequisites on your computer
2. Using the ink! CLI to start a new project
3. Building and testing your contract
4. Deploying your contract on a local Edgeware node
5. Interacting with your contract using the Polkadot UI
6. Creating a basic flipper contract
7. Creating a simple incrementer contract
8. Creating a more complex ERC20 contract

In the [EVM tutorials](4/evm-introduction.md), we will cover:

1. Setting up an Edgeware node
2. Setting up Metamask to work with Edgeware
3. Using Remix as an Ethereum IDE to compile, deploy, and call a contract
4. Using Truffle to deploy a contract to Edgeware
5. Using Web3.js to interact with Edgeware contracts programmatically

We would love for you to give feedback in these early stages, so please feel free to open a PR or comment on Commonwealth!
